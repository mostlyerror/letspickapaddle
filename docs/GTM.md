## 2. Core Value Proposition & Positioning

### Value Proposition
> **Stop guessing. Start playing better.**
> Answer 10 questions about your game, get 3 paddle recommendations matched to *your* play style—with clear explanations for why each one fits.

### Positioning Statement
For intermediate pickleball players frustrated by overwhelming paddle choices and unreliable advice, **[Product Name]** is the recommendation engine that matches paddle specs to your actual playing style. Unlike generic reviews, affiliate-driven "best of" lists, or hit-or-miss pro shop advice, we use a validated algorithm that explains *why* each paddle fits your game.

### Key Messages by Persona

| Persona | Lead Message |
|---------|--------------|
| The Upgrader | "Ready to upgrade? Find the paddle that matches your 3.5 game—not your wallet." |
| The Researcher | "Arm issues? We filter for paddles that won't set you back." |
| The Competitor | "Dial in your swing weight. Optimize your baseline game." |

## 3. Competitive Differentiation

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Weakness We Exploit |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Pro shop staff** | Inconsistent expertise; limited inventory bias |
| **"Best Paddles 2026" articles** | Generic lists; affiliate bias; no personalization |
| **Pickleball Central/retailers** | Filter-based browsing requires existing knowledge |
| **Demo programs** | Requires knowing what to try; time/cost barrier |
| **Reddit/Facebook groups** | Anecdotal; conflicting advice; style mismatch |

### Our Differentiation
1. **Personalized matching** — Quiz adapts to skill level; no jargon for beginners
2. **Transparent reasoning** — Every recommendation explains the "why"
3. **Ergonomic filtering** — First tool to specifically address injury considerations
4. **Deterministic algorithm** — Same inputs = same outputs (builds trust vs. "sponsored" recommendations)

### Defensibility
- Proprietary paddle database with verified specs (not scraped)
- Algorithm trained/validated against user satisfaction data over time
- Brand partnerships create switching costs for retailers

### Tier 2: Medium ROI / Medium Cost (Month 2-3)

### Tier 3: Scale Channels (Month 4+)

## 5. Pricing Strategy Considerations

### Revenue Model: Affiliate-First

| Revenue Stream | V1 (MVP) | V1.1+ |
|----------------|----------|-------|
| **Affiliate commissions** | ✓ Primary (8-15% per sale) | ✓ Primary |
| **Premium features** | — | Compare 10+ paddles, saved profiles, unlimited retakes |
| **B2B licensing** | — | White-label for retailers ($500-2K/mo) |
| **Sponsored placements** | — | "Featured" paddle slots (clearly disclosed) |

### Pricing Principles
1. **Free quiz, free recommendations** — Maximize funnel volume; monetize via affiliate conversion
2. **No paywall on core value** — Trust is the product; gating erodes credibility
3. **Premium = power user features** — "Advanced mode" sliders, comparison exports, profile history ($5-10/mo or $50/yr)
4. **B2B pricing by shop volume** — Small shops: $500/mo; regional chains: $1.5K/mo; national: custom

### Affiliate Economics
- Average paddle price: $150
- Average commission: 10%
- Revenue per conversion: $15
- Target conversion rate (6mo): 8% → **$1.20 revenue per quiz completion**
- Target conversion rate (12mo): 12% → **$1.80 revenue per quiz completion**
